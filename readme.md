As a player, I want to have the "Timer" button activate by a click,
so that I can cont



ReAct is the title of the game i will be working on for this
first project assignment.

The Rule of the Game:

Once you click he timer button the game will start.  
The boxes will flicker red lights in random order. 
This will test your reaction time by how many red lights you can see
within the given amount of time.
Click on the red lights as fast as you can before 
they dissapear.  The person with the highest amount of red lights clicked
wins the game.
